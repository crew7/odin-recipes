    <h1>
        Salmon
    </h1>
    <p> I really like salmon. Do you like my salmon? <br>
        I eat salmon every day. All day. It never stops.
     </p>
     <p>Salmon is great because:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It tastes good
                </li>
                <li>
                    It looks good
                </li>
                <li>
                    It has a color
                </li>
            </ul>
     </p>
     <p>
         This is how you make salmon:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Get ingredients
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cook them
                </li>
                <li>
                    Look, now you have salmon!
                </li>
            </ol>
     </p>

    <p>
        Here is a picture of salmon that I definitely made, it is just a total coincidence that it is the first pop-up on google!
